Addressing Unconscious Bias
Addressing Unconscious Bias in the Workplace

What is Unconscious Bias?
Unconscious bias, also known as implicit bias, refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. These biases, which encompass both favorable and unfavorable assessments, are activated involuntarily and without an individual's awareness or intentional control.

Common Types of Unconscious Bias in the Workplace:
• Affinity Bias: The tendency to warm up to people like ourselves.
• Halo Effect: The tendency to think everything about a person is good because you like that person.
• Perception Bias: The tendency to form stereotypes and assumptions about certain groups that make it impossible to be objective about members of those groups.
• Confirmation Bias: The tendency to seek out information that confirms pre‑existing beliefs or assumptions.
• Gender Bias: Preferring one gender over another.

Self‑Assessment: Recognizing Your Own Biases
Take a moment to reflect on your potential biases. Consider whether you tend to favor candidates who remind you of yourself, make assumptions based on appearance, or connect more easily with individuals from similar backgrounds.

Strategies for Addressing Unconscious Bias:

Awareness: Recognize that everyone has biases and work to identify your own.

Education: Provide unconscious bias training for all employees, particularly those involved in hiring and promotions.

Structured Processes: Implement standardized interviews and evaluation methods to reduce subjective judgments.

Interactive Exercises: Engage employees with interactive modules and resource links for further learning.
