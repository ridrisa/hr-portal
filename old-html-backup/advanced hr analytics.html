    <h2>2. Advanced HR Metrics & Strategic Analytics</h2>

    <h3>2.0 Objective & Strategic Context</h3>

    <p>This module provides the framework and toolset to elevate the HR function from a traditional reporting center to a strategic analytics powerhouse. The goal is to move beyond descriptive metrics (what happened) and diagnostics (why it happened) into the realms of <strong>predictive (what will likely happen), prescriptive (what should we do about it), and causal (what is the financial impact of our actions)</strong> analytics. This evolution is essential for driving strategic workforce decisions that are directly tied to an organization's core objectives of growth, productivity, risk management, and cost leadership.</p>

    <h3>2.1 The Analytics Maturity Model</h3>

    <p>Organizations can use this model to self-assess their current capabilities and chart a course for advancement. A company can be at different levels for different HR domains (e.g., Level 3 in recruitment analytics but Level 1 in learning analytics).</p>

    <h3>2.4 Predictive & Prescriptive Analytics Use Cases</h3>

    <h4>2.4.1 Attrition Forecast Model (Gradient Boosted Trees)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>  <strong>Objective:</strong> To predict the likelihood of a given employee voluntarily leaving the company within the next 180 days.</li>
        <li>  <strong>Key Features (Input Data):</strong> `tenure_in_days`, `time_since_last_promotion`, `comp-ratio_to_midpoint`, `manager_turnover_history`, `quarterly_engagement_score_delta`, `commute_distance_in_km`, `internal_job_applications_count`, `training_hours_last_6_months`, `team_size`.</li>
        <li>  <strong>Output:</strong> A `probability_of_exit_180_days` score between 0.0 and 1.0 for each employee.</li>
        <li>  <strong>Prescriptive Action:</strong> `IF probability_of_exit > 0.65 AND latest_performance_rating >= 3/5 THEN trigger_manager_alert("High-Risk Employee: Schedule Retention Discussion & Review Compensation")`.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2.4.2 Workforce Demand Planning (Time-Series Forecasting)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>  <strong>Objective:</strong> To predict the required headcount for specific role clusters (e.g., "Customer Support Agent," "Backend Engineer") over the next 12-24 months.</li>
        <li>  <strong>Model:</strong> Use time-series forecasting models like ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTMs, trained on historical headcount data and incorporating business drivers like sales forecasts or new product launch dates.</li>
        <li>  <strong>Prescriptive Action:</strong> The model's output feeds directly into the strategic workforce plan, highlighting future gaps between predicted demand and the current talent pipeline capacity, allowing recruitment to begin proactively.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.5 Data Governance, Ethics & KSA Compliance</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>  ✅ <strong>Data Stewardship:</strong> Assign a formal "Data Steward" for each HR domain (Recruitment, Compensation, Performance, etc.) who is responsible for data quality and definitions within that domain.</li>
        <li>  📄 <strong>Data Catalog:</strong> Maintain a data catalog where every metric is defined, including its formula, data source, refresh rate, and sensitivity classification (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted PII).</li>
        <li>  ⚠️ <strong>Access Control (RBAC):</strong> Implement strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enforced via IAM and supplemented by row-level security in the data warehouse. For example, an HR Business Partner should only see data for the departments they support.</li>
        <li>  🇸🇦 <strong>PDPL Compliance:</strong> All analytics activities must comply with the Saudi Personal Data Protection Law. This includes documenting a lawful basis for processing employee data, securing explicit consent for sensitive data, and ensuring that any cross-border transfers of PII to cloud regions outside KSA are legally compliant.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.6 Executive People Scorecard (Visualization Reference)</h3>
    <p>A best-practice executive scorecard is often a 4-quadrant grid layout, designed for at-a-glance consumption.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>  <strong>Layout:</strong></li>
        <li>  Top-Left: <strong>Workforce & Productivity</strong> (Headcount, Revenue per FTE, Labor Cost %)</li>
        <li>  Top-Right: <strong>Talent Management</strong> (Quality of Hire, Promotion Rate, Bench Strength)</li>
        <li>  Bottom-Left: <strong>Engagement & Culture</strong> (Engagement Index, Voluntary Turnover, DEI Score)</li>
        <li>  Bottom-Right: <strong>Recruitment & Cost</strong> (Time-to-Fill, Cost per Hire, Vacancy Cost)</li>
        <li>  <strong>Color Rules:</strong> Green (≥ target), Amber (within 10% of target), Red (missed target).</li>
        <li>  <strong>Delivery:</strong> Exported as a PDF for the weekly/monthly leadership meeting, with a link to the interactive, drill-down version in the BI portal.</li>
    </ul>
