Addressing Unconscious Bias in the Workplace

What is Unconscious Bias?  
Unconscious bias, also known as implicit bias, refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. These biases, which encompass both favorable and unfavorable assessments, are activated involuntarily and without an individual's awareness or intentional control.

Common Types of Unconscious Bias in the Workplace:  
• Affinity Bias: The tendency to warm up to people like ourselves.  
• Halo Effect: The tendency to think everything about a person is good because you like that person.  
• Perception Bias: The tendency to form stereotypes and assumptions about certain groups that make it impossible to be objective about members of those groups.  
• Confirmation Bias: The tendency to seek out information that confirms pre-existing beliefs or assumptions.  
• Gender Bias: Preferring one gender over another.

Self-Assessment: Recognizing Your Own Biases  
Take a moment to reflect on your own potential biases. Consider whether you tend to favor candidates who remind you of yourself, have made assumptions about a person’s abilities based on appearance, or find yourself connecting more easily with people from similar backgrounds.

Strategies for Addressing Unconscious Bias:  
1. Awareness: Recognize that everyone has biases and actively work to identify your own.  
2. Education: Provide unconscious bias training for all employees, especially those involved in hiring and promotion decisions.  
3. Structured Processes: Implement structured interviews and performance evaluation processes to reduce the impact of individual biases.  
4. Additional interactive exercises and resource links.
